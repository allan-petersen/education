A query language for your API and is able to fulfill any queries across multiple databases

GraphQL allows to decribe what type of data you can expect


Setup
====?
npm init
npm i express
npm i --save-dev @babel/cli @babel/core @babel/node @babel/preset-env

npm i nodemon

npm i graphql express-graphql


Misc
====
RS-3 to restart the server
babel-node -e js // Compile the javascript code.

The Inital GraphQl setup:

On the clinet side
==================
Define a query

One the server side
===================
Define a resolver. Root
So once we call into this resolver, which is of type query, we should get ea response
Define the GraphQl server

The endpoint will use the express-GraphQL package to create a GraphQL server.

graphiql is basically a fron end interface, that the GraphQL team has built. So we can actuallly see, when we make requests to the server,
as supposed to go through an endpoint, we're going to use grahpiQL just to represent, what we're working on rigth now.

Basic GraphQL schema
====================
To be be to make queries in GraphQL, you need to define a schema, like we started working on here.
The schema defines the quury type, an then also what it is expecting.

And then our resolver, will actually resolve the results from each API endpoint.

So the type definition proivides what type of data we expect, and the resolver gets the data for us.

Object types and fields
=======================

Query and mutation types
========================

Queries:

Mutations: Create, update

Resolvers
=========
Basically resolvers are the functions the respond to queries and mutations.
They are the functions, that give us the result of the query.

type is for query
input is for mutation

mutation {
  createProduct(input: {name: "Widget2", description: "Another widget for your garden2", price: 44.99, soldout: ONSALE, inventory: 2, stores: [{store: "Pasadana2"}, {store: "Loas Angeles2"}]}) {
    price
    name
    description
    id
  }
}

mutation {
  updateProduct(input: {
    id: "5cb05b9b876bd083a6e4",
	price: 50.99,
	sores: [
	{ store: "Orlando"},
	{ store: "Los Angeles"},
	]
	}) {
	  price
	  name
	}
}

mutation {
  deleteProduct(id: "5cb05b9b876bd083a6e4")
}  

query {
  getProduct(id: "5cb05b9b876bd083a6e4") {
    price
    name
    description
  }
}

Mongo DB
========
npm install mongoose --force

Now we need to apply that schema to the widgets connection (database)
