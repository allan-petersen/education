A.Authentication
================

Single Sign ON
==============

Token request to the Identity Provider

The confirmed token follows the user across 
services taht accept token forwarding.

Trusted relationship between the service provdier and the identity provider

Federation
==========
A collection of domains (or service providers) with established trust between one another, following standards.

Single sign-on (SSO9 is part of the federation framework

3 protocols used in federation
==============================
SAML - Security Assertion Markup language
Passes authentication between an identity provder and a service provider. 
Mostly used in Web browsers
XML

Oauth 2.0
Requests authentication without sharing passwords.

Login via Facebook account. Facebook issues a token that can be use in to another web site.

OpenId Connnect (OIDC)
======================
Request autehntication wirh additional user details.
Extends the token protocol from oauth.

Oath does not include any information that is identifieable in its token.
OIDC allows for sharing account data from one app√¶ication to another.

AirBnB (example) may request to have the users profile and email adrees iformation in addition to use the toke to validate the users identifity.


Federation (SSO is the most commonly used approach to federation) can create a simple user experience by
sharing identity validation amongs a group of trusted service providers


B. Authorization
================
Least priviledge

Provisioning  = proper access

Identity lifecycle

Zero trust
==========
No one is trusted
Verification is required for access.

Role Mining
===========

Passwords
=========

Password less
=============
Biometrics
Authenticator application
Security keys. Fido2 Keys?
