Inversion of Control (IoC)
==========================
Container maintains your class dependencies.
Objects  are injected at runtime or startup time.
An object accepts the dependencies for cunstruction instead of constructing them (or though setter injection)
If your class cannot operate without a dependency, then this dependency should be injected via construtors.
If your class can threat thedependecy as optional or can accept multiple but variable concrete instances of the denpendency, 
then it can be injected via setter injection.

This allows interfaces to be dependencies instead of concreate objects.

The Application Context

The Application Context encapsulates the Beanfactory
