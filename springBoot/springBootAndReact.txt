Spring Boot and React
Build Scalable and Dynamic Web Apps

Node.js version 19.6.0

See React.js Essential Training

React for UI
============
Thymeleaf: Renders every page serverside and powered by a Spring Boot Controller

React: seep learningcurve.
2 step build.

Install react
=============
npx create-react-app src/ui
cd src/ui
npm install react-router-dom

Setting up the build:

Node server, that exposes the react application on port 3000
(Static files and HTML pages and some JavaScript)
Node is doing the serving of the application.'

SpringBoot aapplication on port 8080.
Sring web can also serve static files in src/main/resources/static
(They get served at the root of tha appication context)

We do not want to run 2 application server

We need to get the output of the build cycle of the react application it src/main/resources/static

We will use a Maven plugin to run the npm build
