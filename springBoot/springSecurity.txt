Filter based Authentication and Aithorization framework
Spring Security also is a web-based exploit prvention
CRSF - Corss-Site Request Forgery
Encrypted secure headers and TLS support

Provides Jakarta EE (previously J2EE) application security services

Authentication Support
======================
HTTP basic and digest, x509 and form-based authentication.
LDAP and Active Directory
OpenId, Jasig CAS (Central Authentication Service) - Single Sign ON- and JAAS 
OAuth and OAuth2, OpenID
Kerberos and SAML

Authorization Support
=====================
Web Request
Method invocation
Domain object access control

Basic Authentication
====================
Passwords
Use a cryptographically sound one-way hash.
Sha 256 is no longer considred secure.

BCrypt

Install Spring CLI. TODO
spring encodepassword password

Athorization
============
WebErrorController implements Errorcontroller

Form-based authentication
=========================
Create login form-based
Implement controller and wiring
Turn it on and test

LDAP for Authentication
=======================
spring-security-ldap

Internal LDAP
=============
Use Embedded LDAP
OpenLDAP
LDAP built into the OS

AD is not LAP, but AD can use LDAP for authentication (through an LDAP API)

Spring LDAP
===========
LADP Use Cases:

Authentication
Not all uses og LADP re securiy related - use spring-ldap-core project
Not always security focused

LDAP Operations
- Query LADP (filters) Use the LDAP template
- Search and Dynamic DN creation
-- Binding, update, delete

Other tree-structured data

Active Directory (AD) vs. LDAP for autentication
================================================
ADFS - SAML based
Active Directory is not LDAP
AD implemnts an LDAP API
AD is much more than LDAP itself.

Directoy Srvices is exposed by AD Lightweight
Directory Services (AD LDS) as an LDAP interface

Authentication with AD
======================
- Uses standard and non standard methods
- Configuration should be very familiar (with LDAP), however
- Nested groups - > SEC-1823 -- does ot work in Spring Security

Authentication Provider
- ActiveDirectoryLdapAutenticationProvider
- Utilized via configure method of WebSecuriyConfigurationAdapter

Introduction to OAuth2
======================
