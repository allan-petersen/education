PostGress
========
Start:
set HOME=C:\work\education\postgress

if not exist "%HOME%\.local\docker\postgresql" mkdir "%HOME%\.local\docker\postgresql"

docker run --rm --name pg-docker -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=local -d -p 5432:5432 -e PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata -v "%HOME%\.local\docker\var/lib/postgresql/data" postgres

Stop:
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -euo pipefail

docker stop pg-docker



docker ps

docker cp C:\work\education\postgress\schema.sql pg-docker:/tmp/schema.sql

docker exec -it pg-docker /bin/bash
psql -d local postgres

\i /tmp/schema.sql

The part  -v "$HOME"/.local/docker//lib/postgresql/data postgres  in the Docker command is using the volume (-v) flag to create a persistent storage for the PostgreSQL data. Let's break it down: 
 
1.  -v  is the flag for creating a volume. 
 
2.  "$HOME"/.local/docker/postgresql/data  is the path on your host machine where the data will be stored.  $HOME  is an environment variable that typically points to the user's home directory. 
 
3.  :  separates the host path from the container path. 
 
4.  /var/lib/postgresql/data  is the path inside the Docker container where PostgreSQL stores its data by default. 
 
5.  postgres  at the end specifies the image to use for creating the container. 
 
This volume mapping ensures that the PostgreSQL data is stored persistently on your host machine, rather than being lost when the container is removed. It allows you to: 
 
1. Preserve your database data between container restarts or removals. 
2. Easily backup your data by accessing the files in the specified host directory. 
3. Share the same data between multiple containers if needed. 
 
This setup provides data persistence and easier management of your PostgreSQL database when using Docker.



DRY - Do not repeat yourself

Introduction to Spring
======================
Spring beans: POJOs configured in the application context.

Data transfer objects (DTOs):
JavaBeans used to move state between layers.

Inversion of control (IoC)
Configuration is building the IoC container.
IoC provides the mechanism of dependency injection.
Allowing a shift in object creation.
The application context wraps the Bean Factory which serves the beans to the runtime of the application.
Sprin Boot provides auto-configuration of the ApplicationContext, 
based on the precense or absence of classes among other conditionals

Introduction to Spring Boot
===========================
Embedded Apache Tomcat (or others).
Auto-configuration of the ApplicationContext
Automatic Servlet mappings
Automatic Controller mapping.


Annotations
===========
Metadata for your code
Often the are used for compiler or runtime instructions.
Greate leverage point for pointcuts (Spring Framework in Depth)

Autoconfiguration
=================
@EnableAutoConfiguraion (or @SpringBootApplication per default enables AutoConfuguration)
IoC container configured based on class path, via the depnedency jars included in the project as well as conbditions
Exclusion proives customized behavior
Spring AutoConfigure operations will stop trying to configure a Bean, if you have already defined that bean in your Configuration 
or in components that are annotated.
Beans in BeanFactory are proxied
Annotation drive proxies
Annotations are easy extension points - to trigger aspects on
You can add behavior as well through the use of aspecting
Order of method call
In you call a metyod internally, the proxy behaviour isn't applied.
Avoid class level internal method calls
Example: Class has getX and getY methods
If from external to that class you call getX, you will get the proxy behaviour
If from external to that class you call getY, you will get the proxy behaviour
If you call getX and within the getX method call, it call getY, you will not have the proxied behaviour, aroun that getY method call

Dependency Injection
====================

Why Build Service Abstractions
==============================

MVC 
===
Model is the data - typically assembled from different pieces of data.
View is the visual display, that is populated - or the JSON structure returned.
Controlloer wires the view with the model

Thymeleaf - the string of the templatae name
JSON - the response body

Template Engine
Rendered View

Controller
==========
Web. HTML, Thymeleaf

@Controller
Annotated for the servlet mapping - That is the URL part, we will respond to
Thymeleaf rovides a DSL for HTML, leaving raw HTML documents
Placeholders for dhynamic data

Angular and react are alternatives
 
RestController
==============
Just another MVC, only our view is JSON.

Status codes matter with Rest.

Testing Spring Boot applications
=================================

Controller Testing 
==================
Servlet API Mocks
Allows testing of request mappings

ModelAndVeiwAssert -
Allows testing of web pages

MockMvc
Test restful webservices

Integration Testing
===================
To mange Spring IoC container caching between tests
To provide dependency injection of test fixture instances
To provide transaction managegement appropriate to integration testing - such that you are not destroying an actual database
To supply Spring-specific base calsses, that assists develpers in writing integration tests

Integration test support
jdbc - ithout mucking with a real database
Annotatyions
TestContext
MockMvc 
TODO - Seee the Spring Documentation on testing

Spring Security Basics
======================
Filter-based authentication and Authprization framework
Expolit prevension - CSRF 
Robust library support - LDAP, Oatuh2, username/password etc.
JWT fronting behind an NGINX controller - exist in Sprig Security.

CRSF
====
CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery. It is a type of security vulnerability found in web applications. CSRF attacks occur when a malicious website, email, or program causes a user's web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site for which the user is currently authenticated. This can happen without the user's knowledge or consent, exploiting the trust that a site has in the user's browser. 

For example, if a user is logged into their bank account and visits a malicious site in another tab, the malicious site could potentially send a request to transfer money from the user's bank account without their consent, if proper protections against CSRF are not in place.

To prevent CSRF attacks, developers can implement measures such as:

1. **Anti-CSRF Tokens**: Adding a unique, secret token to each form submission that the server verifies.
2. **SameSite Cookies**: Setting cookies to be sent only in a first-party context.
3. **Checking Referer Headers**: Ensuring that requests originate from trusted sources.
4. **User Interaction Verification**: Requiring user interaction for sensitive actions, such as re-entering a password.
