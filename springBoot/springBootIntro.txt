The part  -v "$HOME"/.local/docker//lib/postgresql/data postgres  in the Docker command is using the volume (-v) flag to create a persistent storage for the PostgreSQL data. Let's break it down: 
 
1.  -v  is the flag for creating a volume. 
 
2.  "$HOME"/.local/docker/postgresql/data  is the path on your host machine where the data will be stored.  $HOME  is an environment variable that typically points to the user's home directory. 
 
3.  :  separates the host path from the container path. 
 
4.  /var/lib/postgresql/data  is the path inside the Docker container where PostgreSQL stores its data by default. 
 
5.  postgres  at the end specifies the image to use for creating the container. 
 
This volume mapping ensures that the PostgreSQL data is stored persistently on your host machine, rather than being lost when the container is removed. It allows you to: 
 
1. Preserve your database data between container restarts or removals. 
2. Easily backup your data by accessing the files in the specified host directory. 
3. Share the same data between multiple containers if needed. 
 
This setup provides data persistence and easier management of your PostgreSQL database when using Docker.

Introduction to Spring
======================
Spring beans: POJOs configured in the application context.

Data transfer objects (DTOs):
JavaBeans used to move state between layers.

Inversion of control (IoC)
Configuration is building the IoC container.
IoC provides the mechanism of dependency injection.
Allowing a shift in object creation.
The application context wraps the Bean Factory which serves the beans to the runtime of the application.
Sprin Boot provides auto-configuration of the ApplicationContext, 
based on the precense or absence of classes among other conditionals
