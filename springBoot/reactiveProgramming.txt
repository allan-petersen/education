Reactive programming
====================
Build async , non blocking and event-driven apps that scale.
Work with async data streams.
Streams emit values over time

Angular
=======
Angular is a mature web and mobile framework, that can we uses with JavaScript of TypeScript.
Build modern apps on web and mobile
Angular CLI accelerates development
Excellent docs and tooling:
https://angular.io.docs
https://github.com/angular/angular

Angular is scalable for large data sets allowing you to
build data models with RxJS or other reactive frameworks
Write async or callback-based code
 
RxJS
==== 
RxJS library is a JavaScript-specific
RxJS Onserver Pattern
RxJS is a JavaScrpt flavor of ReactiveX
One of the core consepts of ReactiveX is:
An observable representation of a set of values, that can push a notification upon state change.
A subject is a specific flavor of observable, that can multicast to multiple observers.
An observer implements an interface, that allows it to consume push notifications from an Oservable in a consistent mamnner.

Subject - a fla vor of an Observable

3 Observers (example)

1. Each observer will subscribe to the subject
2. Event - causes subject to change state
3. The subject will notify all the subscribed observers of the change
