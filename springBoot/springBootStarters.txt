Starter
=======
In Spring Boot, a starter is a pre-configured, ready-to-use set of dependencies,
that simplifies the inclusion of specific functionalities or libraries in your Spring Boot application.

Auto-configuration
==================
Auto-configuration in Spring Boot is a feature that automatically configures the Spring application context,
based on the dependencies present in the classpath.
Look for a class with a name following the pattern “xxxAutoConfiguration,” where “xxx” corresponds to the module you are interested in

There are 2 most popular conditions 
@ConditionalOnClass and @ConditionalOnProperty. 
They are commonly used in auto-configuration classes to conditionally enable or disable certain configurations
based on the presence of classes or properties.
