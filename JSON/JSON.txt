JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
It’s a lightweight data-interchange format that’s easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.

Key Points:

Text-based: Data is stored as plain text.

Language-independent: Even though it’s derived from JavaScript, almost all programming languages can use it.

Structure: Uses key-value pairs (like dictionaries in Python or objects in JavaScript) and arrays (lists).

Basic Rules:

Data is in name/value pairs:
============================

"name": "Alice"


Data is separated by commas.

Curly braces {} hold objects.
=============================

Square brackets [] hold arrays.
===============================

Example:
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 25,
  "isStudent": false,
  "skills": ["Python", "JavaScript", "SQL"],
  "address": {
    "city": "New York",
    "zip": "10001"
  }
}


In this example:

"name", "age", "isStudent", etc., are keys.

"Alice", 25, false, etc., are the corresponding values.

JSON is widely used for APIs, config files, and data storage.
