Type System
===========
Val-  creates in immutable declaration
Var - is used for a mutable declaration

The only type we nedd to specify the type a variable is when the compiler is unable to determine it.

When we do not give the variable a definition,we must give it a type

var myLong = 123456L
var myShort: Short = 12
var myByte: Byte = 127

val anInt: Int = 1
val aLong: Long = anInt.toLong()

Control flow - if
=================
If is an expression in Kotlin, not a statement (as it is in Java).

Statement:Program instructions that return no value; can't be on the right side of on equasl sign.
Expression: Program instructions that return values; can be on the right side of on equasl sign.

// int lowest = (a<b) ? a : b;    // Java

val lowest = if (myInt < anInt) myInt else anInt;
println("The lowest value is $lowest");

Control flow - when
