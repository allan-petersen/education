I am the sender of an electronical document.
How do I in software sign the document using a private kye and a certficate?

How Digital Signing Works (Conceptual Overview)

You hash the document (e.g., SHA-256).

You encrypt the hash with your private key → this becomes the signature.

You attach your certificate (public key) so others can verify it.

The recipient uses your public key (from your certificate) to validate the signature.


PdfReader reader = new PdfReader("input.pdf");
FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("signed.pdf");

PrivateKey key = ...;            // your private key
Certificate[] chain = ...;       // your cert chain

PdfSigner signer = new PdfSigner(reader, out, false);
IExternalSignature pks = new PrivateKeySignature(key, "SHA256", "BC");
IExternalDigest digest = new BouncyCastleDigest();

signer.signDetached(digest, pks, chain, null, null, null, 0, PdfSigner.CryptoStandard.CMS);


RECEIVE 
=======
I am the receiver of an electronical document.
How do I in software verify the sender of the document using the signature,
and that the contens of the document has not been tampered with?

When you verify a digital signature, software performs two checks:

1. Integrity Check (Has the document been modified?)

The software recomputes a hash of the document (SHA-256, etc.).

It decrypts the signature using the public key from the sender’s certificate.

If the two hashes match → the document is untampered.

2. Authenticity Check (Is the signature from the real sender?)

The sender’s certificate is validated:

Is it issued by a trusted CA?

Is it valid (not expired, not revoked)?

Does it match the signature?

If both checks pass → the document is authentic and intact.
