NoSQL - Not only SQL

Flexible, scalable, fast

Relational databases. Reliable, consistent, excellent integrity

NoSQL: Each row does not need to have the same columns

CAP Theorem (Consisitency, Availablilty, Partition tolerance)
=============================================================
We can only have 2 of these 3 items.


Query a NoSQL database
======================
{
property_type:"Appartment"
}

Find houses with 2 bedrooms and one bath and a minimum night stay of 2.
{
property_type:"House",
bedrooms:2
bathrooms:1
minimum_nights:"2"
}

Different Types of noSQL Storage
================================
1. Key-value
============
Suited for: Caching, Session-management, Leaderboards, real-time inventory systems, fraud mitigation, claims processing
Products: DynamoDB, Redis, Oracle NoSQL 
MSET firstname "Mel" lastname "McGee"
MGET firstname lastname1 
1) "Mel"
2) "Mcgee"

2. Document
===========
Similar to Key-value, but the value is stored as a document (MongoDB stores the document in a format called BSON - binary JSON)
Suited for: Flexibility, but no a lot of complex queries, CMS, Large document Stores, Websites, User profiles, Real-Time Analytics, Big Data
Products: MongoDB, Apache's CouchDB, Azure Cosmos DB

db.biod.find( {"name.last": "McGee" } )
db.biod.find( {"name.first": "Mel" } )

3. Wide-column
===============
Subset of key-value, They are like relational database in some ways.
The use tables, rows and columns, but columns can vary
Tables can be created, altered even dropped at runtime
It is best to yse these, whe you know the queries, and model your tables around queries,
instead of how we would do it in relational databse modelling, where you are modelling your tables around the data.
Wide-colunm stores can be used for very fast querying of specific parts of data, but not whole rows
Large volmes of data.
Suited for: For dealing with extremely large amount of data, where speed is of utmost importance, big data, petrabytes f data, inventory management, analytics systems 
Products: Cassandra, HBase

CQL example
"Bonuses"  {
row1 : {"ID":1, "Last":"McGee", "First":"Mel", "Bonus:8000},
row2 : {"ID":2, "Last":"Smith", "First":"Jane", "Bonus:4000},
}

UPDATE Customer SET branch = 'main' WHERE custage >2;
